WeatherApp - Global City Weather Forecast
    This Python-based WeatherApp uses a web API to fetch and display real-time weather information for any city across the world. The application allows users to input the name of a city, and it retrieves data such as current temperature, weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.), humidity, wind speed, and more.

Key Features:
    Fetches real-time weather data from a reliable weather API.
    Displays essential weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the current weather conditions.
    Supports cities from all over the world, allowing users to check the weather in any location.
    Simple and user-friendly interface for easy access to weather information.

Platform Compatibility:
    The code can be run on any platform that supports Python, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    To run the app, ensure that Python is installed along with necessary libraries like requests for API handling.
    No special hardware or software is required apart from a Python compiler and internet connection to access the weather API.

Technologies used:
    Python (for backend logic)
    API integration (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API, WeatherAPI)
    JSON for handling data returned by the API

How to Run:
    Install Python from the official Python website.
    Make sure the requests library is installed (if not, use pip install requests).
    Run the Python script on any platform that supports Python.
    Enter the name of the city to get instant weather updates.
